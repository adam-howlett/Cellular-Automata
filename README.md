# CellularAutomata
Recreating the results from Nagel &amp; Schreckenberg 

This project was completed in service of my Physics Degree some years ago, based on the work of [Kai Nagel &amp; Michael Schreckenberg](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/jpa-00246697/document). It is concerned with the simulation of traffic in a 'cellular automaton' model, whereby cars on a road are reduced to single cells in an array, and evolve over time according to a simple ruleset. A full explanation can be found on its (project page)[https://adam-howlett.github.io/cellularautomata.html].

The files in the project recreate the main results found in my (project report)[https://adam-howlett.github.io/cellularautomata.html] from the time, and will be extended in the future.
